MMO Online HD
=============
###Round Two 
MMO Online spent too much time reinventing the wheel. Time to embrace the future, where everything is built on everything else. There are many reasons why this will be objectively better than the original.
#####pixi.js
The fastest JavaScript 2D graphics engine around, with tons of handy features. 
#####CreateJS
PreloadJS and SoundJS for asset loading and sound.
#####Improved Latency Compensation
The old system was modelled somewhat after TCP's "ramp up, fall back" mechanism. It was okay, but it wasn't great. The new scheme is much smarter, smoother, and all around better.
#####Better Practices
The first game was basically thrown together. This time, things are actually organized. It helps.
