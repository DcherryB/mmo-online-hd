THOUGHTS

Change client message syntax to reduce size:
	Rather than {"type":"order", "order":{whatever}}
	Just [Orders.TYPES.MOVE, {params}]

	Every order obviously has a type
		saves |"t":| (4 chars)
	These can be easily enumerated on both client and server
		saves a couple of quotes (2 chars)

	Shave the array syntax off entirely
		saves |[,]| (3 chars)
	Further, remove the curlies around the object 
		saves 2 chars, just 1 if using a new delimiter after the number

	NEW NEW SYNTAX:
		3|"param":"string", "param2":num

	TOTAL SAVINGS:
		About 10 chars per message.
		Yay!

	NOTE: will need to tweak the message compressor
	OTHER NOTE: expect that most messages from client are orders, so the order types can just be among the message types.

	~~For now just leave this shit uncompressed.~~


Organize this god damn client holy shit.
